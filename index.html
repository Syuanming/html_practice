    <h2>Other information</h2>

    <p>
        In the strip from November 3, 1950, Charlie Brown said that he was "only four years old". However, he aged over
        the next two decades, being six years old as of November 17, 1957, and "eight-and-a-half years old" by July 11,
        1979. Later references continue to peg Charlie Brown as being approximately eight years old.
    </p>

    <p>
        The character's creator, Charles M. Schulz, said that Charlie Brown "has to be the one who suffers, because he
        is a
        caricature of the average person.
    </p>

    <p>
        Charlie Brown is characterized as a person who frequently suffers, and as a result, is usually nervous and lacks
        self-confidence.
